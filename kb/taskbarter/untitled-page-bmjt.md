Frontend: React, Redux, Bootstrap
Backend: NodeJS, Express, MongoDB
Deployment: Github, Heroku, MongoDB Atlas

It could not have been possible without the Github Student Developer Pack.
- I deployed the app on Heroku Hobby Dyno which I got from #GithubSDP
- I used MongoDB Atlas to host the database from the $200 credits that I got from #GithubSDP
- The emails sent from the server are sent through SendGrid's 15k/mo email package which I also got from #GithubSDP
- Icons used in the website are from Icons8 pro package which I got from #GithubSDP
